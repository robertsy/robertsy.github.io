I'm a Data Scientist / Statistician with 10+ years of experience across academia and industry. I love working with complex data sources to answer questions about the real world. From mapping of landslide risks to estimating the causal impact of a campaign using geo-experiments, I specialize in settings where there is a lot of structure in data (e.g. maps, time series, correlated observations or hierarchical relationships) and deep expertise (e.g. causal relationships, risk knowledge, expert intuition or dynamical systems). Instead of throwing aways all this information, it is much more useful to develop methods that integrate them in a joint model combining prior knowledge and data.

## Expertise

I have of track record of leading successful data science projects from ideation to productization both in industry and in research. I have worked in teams of size 1 to more than 10, on time scale of a few weeks to a few years. In my experience, the upfront work of defining the problem and deeply understanding what is desired of the data always pays off: I learned the power of working iteratively in complex data science projects, always being open to question assumptions and change direction. If you are interested in seeing how this would look in practice for your application, consider my [consulting services](../consulting/).

Mastering the statistical techniques is *easy* by comparison to knowing what to do. Still, here are some of the techniques and tools I have gained familiarity with over the years:

* Programming in R and Python
* Statistics and Machine Learning
* Spatio-temporal data analysis
* Bayesian statistics
* Probabilistic forecasting
* Causal inference
* DevOps in cloud environments

## Experience

* Senior Data Scientist at Google
* External Lecturer at ETH Zürich
* Data Scientist at Swiss Re

## Education

* BSc in Environmental Sciences at University Lausanne
* MSc in Statistics at ETH Zürich
* PhD in Statistics at ETH Zürich (in collaboration with MeteoSwiss)
