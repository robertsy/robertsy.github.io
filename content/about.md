I'm a data scientist / statistician with 10+ years of experience across academia and industry in the fields of Climate, Environment and Risks. I work with complex data sources to answer questions about the real world. From mapping of landslide risks to predicting the origin of dialects, I specialize in settings with **complex data structure** (geospatial, time series, correlated observations or hierarchies), deep **domain expertise** (risks knowledge, dynamical systems or causal relationships), and questions that go **beyond simple predictions** (inference, probabilistic forecasting, or decisions with non-standard loss functions). Instead of throwing aways all this information, it is much more useful to develop models that integrate them together, combining prior knowledge and data: this is exactly what Bayesian methods excel at.

## Expertise

I have a track record of leading successful data science projects from ideation to productization. I have worked in teams of size 1 to more than 10, on time scales of a few weeks to a few years, across fields and with various stakeholders. In my experience, the upfront cost of defining the problem and understanding what is desired of the data always pays off: with the years I learned the power of working iteratively in complex data science projects, always being open to challenge assumptions and change direction as evidence comes in - basically applying the scientific method to working with data, as the job title implies but doesn't always entail.

Mastering the statistical techniques and technology is *easy* by comparison to knowing how data can be used to solve real problems. That being said, here are some of the techniques and tools I have gained expertise with over the years:

* Programming in R and Python
* From prototyping to deployment of models in production
* Statistics and Machine Learning
* Spatio-temporal data
* Bayesian inference
* Probabilistic forecasting
* Causality
