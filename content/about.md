I'm a data scientist / statistician with 10+ years of experience across academia and industry in the fields of Climate, Environment and Risks. I work with complex data sources to answer questions about the real world. From mapping of landslide risks to estimating the causal impact of online campaigns using geo-experiments, I specialize in settings where there is a lot of structure in data (geospatial, time series, correlated observations or hierarchies) and deep domain expertise (risks knowledge, dynamical systems or causal relationships). Instead of throwing aways all this information, it is much more useful to develop methods that integrate them in a joint model combining prior knowledge and data: this is what Bayesian statistics excel at.

## Expertise

I have a track record of leading successful data science projects from ideation to productization. I have worked in teams of size 1 to more than 10, on time scale of a few weeks to a few years, across fields and with various stakeholders. In my experience, the upfront cost of defining the problem and understanding what is desired of the data always pays off: with the years I learned the power of working iteratively in complex data science projects, always being open to challenge assumptions and change direction as evidence comes in - basically applying the scientific method to working with data, as the job title implies but doesn't always entail.

Mastering the statistical techniques and technology is *easy* by comparison to knowing how data can be used to solve real problems. Still, here are some of the techniques and tools I have gained familiarity with over the years:

* Programming in R and Python
* DevOps from prototyping to deployment of models in production
* Statistics and Machine Learning
* Spatio-temporal data
* Bayesian inference
* Probabilistic forecasting
* Causality
