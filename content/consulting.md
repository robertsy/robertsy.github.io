I offer bespoke consulting services to organizations facing challenges in the fields of Climate, Environment and Risks. My expertise is on applying statistics and data science to problems which out-of-the-box tools cannot address. These typically involve **complex data structure**, extensive **domain expertise**, and questions that go **beyond simple predictions**.

Not every organization has exabyte-scale data, but every organization has deep knowledge of their domain of application. Together, we can make the best use of your data, linking with external datasets when relevant, and, most importantly, integrating as much as possible your expertise in the final models.

If any of the things I wrote about sounds interesting to you, let's chat!
