I offer bespoke consulting services to organizations facing challenges that typical out-of-the-box tools cannot address. Typically these involve **complex data** structures (spatial data, time series, correlated observations or hierarchical relationships), strong **domain expertise** (causal relationships, risk knowledge, expert intuition or dynamical systems), and questions that go **beyond simple predictions** (inference about parameters, probabilistic predictions, or decisions with non-standard loss functions).

Not every everyone has exabyte-scale data, but everyone has deep knowledge of their domain. Together, we can make the best use of your data, linking with external datasets when relevant, and, most importantly, integrating as much as possible your expertise in the final models.

From my experience, here are some specific domains where my expertise can be particularly helpful:

* Environment and Energy
* Climate and Weather
* Natural Catastrophes
* Development Aid

If any of the things I wrote about sounds interesting to you, let's chat!
