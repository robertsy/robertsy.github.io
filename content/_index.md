I'm passionnate about using data to help people have an impact on the world. I studied at *ETH Zürich* and worked at *Swiss Re* and *Google* before starting my own consultancy.

My experience spans data assimilation for weather forecasting, spatio-temporal analysis of environmental data, catastrophe modelling in (re-)insurance, estimating risks and uncertainty with Bayesian statistics, and drawing causal inference from experimental and observational data.

What these various applications have in common is to not rely on data only, but to combine them with the deep expertise and insights of people working in their domains for many years.
