I'm passionnate about using statistics and data science in the fields of Climate :sun_behind_rain_cloud:, Environment :herb: and Risks :fire:. I studied at *ETH Zürich* and worked at *Swiss Re* and *Google*. I am open for individual [consulting](../consulting/) engagements.

My experience spans data assimilation for weather forecasting using Bayesian methods, spatio-temporal modelling of environmental data with Machine Learning, risks and uncertainty estimation for extreme events in (re-)insurance, all the way to designing geo-experiments to measure the causal impact of online campaigns.

One thing that these various applications have in common is to combine data with deep expertise and insights of people: AI and data have a great potential on their own. Used in conjonction with human intelligence they can actually change the world.
